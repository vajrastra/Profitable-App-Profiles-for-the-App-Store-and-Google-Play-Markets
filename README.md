# Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets

This project aims to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for building successful apps that attract more users and generate revenue.

## Project Overview

As part of our analysis, we explored two datasets containing information about Android apps from Google Play and iOS apps from the App Store. We performed data cleaning, removed duplicate entries, and focused on free, English-language apps, which align with our company's business model.

We analyzed the data to identify app genres that are popular and have the potential for success on both the App Store and Google Play markets.

## Data Exploration

We used data from two datasets:
- [Google Play dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing information about Android apps.
- [App Store dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing information about iOS apps.

We explored columns such as 'Category', 'Genres', 'prime_genre', 'Installs', 'Rating Count', and more to understand app categories, user reviews, and installations.

## Data Cleaning

We cleaned the data by:
- Removing inaccurate data, such as incorrect ratings.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Removing non-English apps.
- Isolating free apps for analysis.

## App Recommendation

Based on our analysis, we recommend building an app around a popular book (preferably a recent one) for both the App Store and Google Play markets. The book could be enhanced with special features like daily quotes, an audio version, quizzes, a discussion forum, and more to provide a unique and valuable user experience.

This recommendation is supported by the fact that book and reference apps have a substantial user base, and the market is not yet saturated with similar apps. By adding special features and capitalizing on the popularity of the book, this app has the potential to attract users and generate revenue.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis in making informed decisions. By examining app data from the App Store and Google Play markets, we identified a potential app profile that aligns with our company's goals and can lead to success in both markets.
